# TM4C1294XL
Programming on TM4C1294 board from Texas instruments 

Here I show my programs made for this board. I'm following a course from EdX called "Embbeded systems. Shape the world"
In my experience I have seen a lot of ways to program on this board but I like how this course teach to program.
I think they do it in a very intuitive way. So I follow the libraries that professor Valvano provides. 

Here you can find how to program:
- Basic programming 
- PWM for motors and servos.
- UART communication
- Interrupts
- ADC/ DAC

This repo is currently in development so I'm going to add new things habitually.
